The program uses the relationships between a stock’s future prices and the stock’s historical data, with its respecting market index historical data, to create multiple multi-linear regression lines which are used to predict the stock’s next week’s future high and low price’s structure. The regression line is built using the stock’s historical “High(s), “Low(s)”, “Close(s)”, “Volume(s)” and the respective market index change in price, all over the past 9-time weeks to predict the future stock’s highest (roof) and lowest (floor) price. The program simultaneously runs new regression models over the past 10 sets of data to collect the accuracy of the regression models on the current 10-week period. This is through the deviation of the predictions compared to the actual highest and lowest price of the weeks. The final product shows the roof and floor prices for the next week, including the safety margins around the predictions shown by the accuracy deviation taken from the past 10 weeks. Finally, the trader can use this analysis to guide their trades through these “BUY” and “SELL” zones optimizing profit and minimize the risk in trading.
